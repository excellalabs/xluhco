# Editing Links on Excella's Instance of Excellaco

Excella has opted to keep its CSV private within cloud storage, so editing links directly in the repo isn't currently an option.

Your options for adding/editing links are:

* If you have access to the storage, you can edit the CSV file directly there.
* You can post in the `#xluhco` channel within Excella's Slack.
* You can [file a new issue](https://github.com/excellalabs/xluhco/issues/new/choose) and choose `Request a Link`
* You can contact @luis-m-gonzalez.
